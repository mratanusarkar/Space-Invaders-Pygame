A pygame Implementation of the popular Classic Atari and NES Arcade games

This is a part of a series of Classic Arcade Games implemented in Pygames.
list of games in this collection:
1. [Space Invaders](https://github.com/mratanusarkar/Space-Invaders-Pygame/) (my version)
2. more coming soon . . .

# Space Invaders
The classic [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) was the first blockbuster arcade video game, responsible for starting the [golden age of video arcade games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_age_of_arcade_video_games). It also sets the template for the [shoot 'em up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up) genre, and influences nearly every shooter game released since then. 

The classic Space Invaders 1978 was created by [Tomohiro Nishikado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomohiro_Nishikado) and was released by [Taito Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taito) in the year 1978.

## Concept
In **my Implementation** of the game, the concept remains the same, i.e the *player spaceship* shoots the *aliens* or *monsters* and in doing so gain *points* followed by *level ups* and *increase in game speed* and *difficulty*.

What differs from the classic implementation and the features are are listed below:
* In each level, the number of *enemies* equals the *level number*, unlike the classic version in which there are 55 enemies each level.
* After a certain number of *kills*, the *difficulty* goes up, resulting in a *speed increase* of the aliens. 
* The *enemy* keeps on respawning and will never die completely.
* The *enemy* may shoot a *laser beam* depending on *random chance* or *probability*.
* The *random chance* or *probability* of the enemy shooting you goes up as level increases.
* The score is incremented on a successful kill and the value is based on the *level number* and *difficulty number*.

## Features
The features of the game is as follows:
* The player can be moved *left* or *right* using the `Left Arrow` and `Right Arrow` keys.
* The game can be **paused** (v1.1.2 onwards) with `Enter key` or `Esc key`.
* The player *levels up* with *increase in number of enemies* and a *level up sound* (v1.1.1 onwards)
* The game has a **background music** (the classic Space Invaders music) which changes and becomes *more intense* with increase in *difficulty*.
* The game pause has the classic sound effect
* Each game object and every Interactions has sound effects.
* The game has **key logging** feature and every input is **logged into the console**
* The game also has **FPS Tracking** and Each **Frame Render time** in miliseconds and displays it in the game.
